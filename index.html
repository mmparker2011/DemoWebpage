                My name is Mack Parker. I was born and raised in Gaston, North Carolina. 
                I graduated from Northampton County High School West and went on to attend North Carolina State University
                and graduated with a BS in Fashion and Textile Management.
                I later went on to attend the University of Phoenix, Online and graduated with a second BS in Information Technology.
                I am hoping to exceed in the training at Revature so I can acquire a job in the Software Development sector and obtain a lucrative career.
